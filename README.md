# Surfs_Up
 The purpose of this analysis was to build on our module work of providing W.Avy with weather analysis within Oahu to help potentially open up a surf and shake shop. We continued by gathering temperature trends for the months of June and December to help determine if the business will be sustainable year round. We did this by writing queires that filtered the date for both months, and converted the data into a list, then created a DataFrame from the lists. This allowed us to generate summary statistics for both months. 

# Results: 

 The results generated 1700 temperatures for the month of June and 1517 temperatures for December. The data showed that the average temperature in the month of June was around 75 degrees and 71 degrees in the month of December. The lowest temperature in June was recorded at 64 degrees and the highest was recorded at 85 degrees. In December the lowest and highest temperatures were 56 degrees and 83 degrees. These temperatures appear to be warm enough year-round for the surf and shake shop to be sustainable througout the year.
